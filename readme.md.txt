"Where Does This Mill’s Water Come From? A data-driven analysis of the frequency of village-themed proverbs and idioms and their associations with country-level markers across Europe"

"Bu değirmenin suyu nereden geliyor?" This is an idiom, one of a wealth of idioms that are used every day in the Turkish language, yet one that belongs to a category of sayings that would have little to no bearing for speakers of many other languages. Having moved directly from a Turkish village state school to an elite Edinburgh high school with little prior experience of the outside world at the age of 13, I was quickly struck by the virtual non existence of a clear divide between the characteristics of Scottish city dwellers and rural folk. Whereas in Turkey the rural and the urban are very obviously distinguished by their appearance, scope,  accent, family structure, relative wealth and use of language, it is fair to say that the rural populations of most European nations are all but city people who happen to live in small communities. The same can be said about the frequency of rural themed sayings, idioms and proverbs in many European communities: they are virtually non existent, presenting a contrast to their sheer ubiquity in languages like Turkish and Spanish. So, where did they go? Did they ever exist? What other generalizations can be made about countries that no longer "walk according to their shepherds", or "call their neighbor's chicken a goose"? Were they early adopters of modernity? Have their economies shifted from primary to secondary and tertiary? Did they have different family structures? I don't know, but I've always had the sense that a sound frequency analysis of rural themed proverbs in a language will fit snugly with existing (and perhaps, surprising) research findings.


Scope of Research:
Languages (8–10): Turkish, English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Greek and Russian.

Time window: “Modern” usage, ie:late-20th to 21st-century media/online text/idiomatic dictionaries.

Data Sources:
While working solely off of idiomatic dictionaries is easy and can be done by simply measuring the frequency of a set of rural themed words (ie: shepherd, barn, cow, soil etc) this is insufficient as I will have trouble identifying which of these idioms are still in frequent use. Therefore I will use this in combination with large sets of movie subtitles downloaded from OpenSubtitles, and run machine learning algorithms to tokenize with spaCy/stanza language models; lemmatize; keep alphabetic tokens, and count tokens per language to enable normalization (per-million words). An added benefit, of course, is that I can highlight both the frequency of idiom usage and the relative frequency of my target idiomatic category within that language.
